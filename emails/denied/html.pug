h3 Hey #{fullName}
p It looks like you're channel didn't get approved. If you'd like to know more, please email me #[a(href="mailto:aftermidnightvideos@gmail.com") aftermidnightvideos@gmail.com]
p The reason why you may have been declined is, I'm worried about my platform being misused. I want to make sure that Reddex is a place where narrators, or people who could genuinely use Reddex for good (and not evil), can operate. With great power comes great
  | responsibility. If I got it wrong with your channel, please email me and let me know how you'll be using Reddex for good.
